# random_perturbation_in_latent_space

this is an experimental and fun approach to image processing. the idea is to encode given image into latent space, apply perturbation using random generated matricies, and then decode them back. 
you can see nonlinear and random transformation of the original image.

example:

<img src ="ex/ex1" width="1000">

<img src ="ex/ex2" width="1000">
